# Don't Burn My Stuff

Don't Burn My Stuff is a Minecraft mod for the fabric mod loader.
It aims to make the Fire Protection enchantment a bit more useful.

## Features
It essentially does two things:
- Makes every item enchantable with Fire Protection (Every means every. So also shears, saplings or dirt)
- Items that are enchanted with Fire Protection don't burn in fire or lava anymore (like netherite)

Note:
The level of the Fire Protection enchantment is irrelevant, even Fire Protection I protects stuff from high heat sources like lava.
Fire Protection is still mutually exclusive to other Protection enchantments. So choose wisely.
